The goal of this project was to develop a software platform capable of detecting malicious software based on its behaviour.
	

The platform was designed to be used by corporations to protect their systems from malware.	

The platform featured three sub-projects, which were the client, server, and sandbox.

The client was a GUI application targeted at Microsoft Windows.

The server was responsible for bridging communications between the client and the sandbox.

The sandbox was responsible for running the malware in a sandboxed environment.

The platform also featured a dashboard allowing administrators to configure the platform.

The client was written in Python 3, using the Tkinter library for creating the GUI.

The server was written in Python 3, using the Flask library for creating the REST API.

\chapter{Conclusion}
% Briefly summarise your context and objectives.
% Remind the reader about the overall rationale and goals of the project.
% Highlight your findings from the System Evaluation chapter.

The goal of this project was to develop a software platform capable of
detecting malicious software based on its behaviour.
To do this files needed to be executed, these files are potentially malicious
so they need to be isolated from the system they are running on.

Users have the ability to download a client, 

The client software communicates with the server using a
RESTful API, which the dashboard also uses

In the objectives, I stated I wanted to create a secure platform, as shown in the evaluation chapter, I showed that the administrator's password is hashed, and in the event of the dashboard being compromised, the plain text password would not be known.

Administrators can input data into various fields patterns for example,
but I found my dashboard wasn't sanitising the inputs,
so a malicious user could input raw HTML and my dashboard would
display raw HTML which is referred to as XSS.

\chapter{Methodology}
% Describe the way you went about your project. Was your approach to the problem valid?
% You need to discuss both your software development methodology and your research methodology.

At the beginning I decided to break the project into three parts, the client, server, and sandbox.

I am using Test Driven Development (TDD) to develop the server endpoints.
I am using the unittest python library to write unit tests for the server endpoints.

The tests are used as a specification for the server endpoints.

Throughout the development I identified tasks that needed to be done.
I created a story in my kanban board for each task, placed it in the Todo column.

I then moved the story to the In Progress column when I started working on it.
When I finished working on the story, I moved it to the Done column.

Git was used for version control.

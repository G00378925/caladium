2. Download Sysinternal Suite, it can be retrieved from [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysinternals-suite).
3. Extract the contents to the root of your drive this will be `C:\` on most systems.
4. Install Racket and Python3, these are required as the sandbox analysis program is written in them.
